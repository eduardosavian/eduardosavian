Hi, I'm a Computer Science Student, the vast majority of these repositories are works done or in process of being done for university activities. The rest are projects to find out more about a particular tool.

**I invite you to know more about my works.**

I use or have used the following tools and frameworks, in descending order of knowledge:
- Python (Flask/FastAPI, Pandas, Matplotlib, Selenium, Numpy e Scikit-Learn);
- .Net
- Java/Kotlin (Spring Boot);
- C/C++;
- JavaScript/TypeScript;
- Julia;
- Assebly MIPS/RISCV.

For versioning tool I use git along with github and OS Linux (Debian/derivados, Fedora e Arch/derivados) e Windows.

I also know how to deal with HTML/CSS (including Bootstrap framework) and SQL (mainly the MySQL database and SQLite).

I know how to use the Office package.

My native language is portuguese, but my english is advanced and I'm in the process of learning german, currently I know the basics of it.
